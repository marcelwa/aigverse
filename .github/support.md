# Support

If you are stuck with a problem using aigverse or have questions, please get in touch at our [Issues](https://github.com/marcelwa/aigverse/issues) or [Discussions](https://github.com/marcelwa/aigverse/discussions). We'd love to help.

You can save time by following this procedure when reporting a problem:

- Try to solve the problem on your own first.
- Search through past [Issues](https://github.com/marcelwa/aigverse/issues) and [Discussions](https://github.com/marcelwa/aigverse/discussions) to see if someone else already had the same problem.
- Before filing a bug report, try to create a minimal working example (MWE) that reproduces the problem. It is much easier to identify the cause for the problem if a handful of lines suffice to show that something is not working.
