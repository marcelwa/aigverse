# Support

If you are stuck with a problem using `aigverse` or have questions, please get in touch at our [Issues](https://github.com/marcelwa/aigverse/issues) or
[Discussions](https://github.com/marcelwa/aigverse/discussions). We'd love to help.

You can save time by following this procedure when reporting a problem:

- Try to solve the problem on your own first.
- Search through past [Issues](https://github.com/marcelwa/aigverse/issues) and [Discussions](https://github.com/marcelwa/aigverse/discussions) to see if someone else already had the same problem.
- Before filing a bug report, try to create a minimal working example (MWE) that reproduces the problem. It is much easier to identify the cause for the problem if a handful of lines suffice to show that something is not working.

# Consulting

`aigverse` is a free, open-source library, and it will continue to be developed and maintained as such.
The project relies on community contributions and the support of its users.

If you or your organization require specific new features, dedicated support, or integration of `aigverse` into your
projects, professional consulting services are available. This is a great way to get the features you need while also
supporting the ongoing maintenance and development of the library.

For inquiries about consulting services, please reach out to [@marcelwa](https://github.com/marcelwa/) directly.
