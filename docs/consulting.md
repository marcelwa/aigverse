# Support and Consulting

`aigverse` is a free, open-source library, and it will continue to be developed and maintained as such.
The project relies on community contributions and the support of its users.

If you or your organization require specific new features, dedicated support, or integration of `aigverse` into your
projects, professional consulting services are available. This is a great way to get the features you need while also
supporting the ongoing maintenance and development of the library.

For inquiries about consulting services, please reach out to [@marcelwa](https://github.com/marcelwa/), directly.
